How to write?
1. The writer who initiated a story is the first one to write a new sentence. You may be as creative as you want, but you can only submit 255 characters per turn.
1. When you submit your text, your turn is over and the other writer will add something to the story.

2. Say yes! Go with whatever the other writer puts into the story and work from there.
2. Examples:
2. Good:
.. player1: I'm so happy you gave me a bunny for my birthday. Thank you!
.. player2: You're welcome! With your love for bunnies I thought that you'd like it.

2. Wrong:
.. player1: I'm so happy you gave me a bunny for my birthday. Thank you!
.. player2: I didn't give you a bunny. I gave you a rat.

quote:
"I never thought I was very creative, but I always wanted to be a novelist. Writing at the Awesome Story Creating App really helped me to come out of my shell. You never know where the story with another writer takes you, which is fun, a bit scary, but it helped me to become a better writer!" - LadyWriter1990
